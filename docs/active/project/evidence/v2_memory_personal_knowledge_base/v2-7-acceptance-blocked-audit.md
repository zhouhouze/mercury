# V2-7 Acceptance Blocked Audit

## Stop Point

V2-1 through V2-6 implementation work is complete within the currently executable, mock-first and controlled-boundary scope.

V2-7 real-data acceptance is not complete and must not be marked passed in this run.

## Blocking Reason

The active V2 acceptance schema requires a real evidence package with:

- at least 24 source samples;
- at least 12 web page sources;
- at least 6 explicitly authorized local document sources;
- at least 6 note / markdown / other supported sources;
- at least 38 operation scenarios;
- screenshot paths for each source result;
- service status samples covering Runtime offline, Adapter degraded / blocked, data_service auth / unreachable / version mismatch, and source build failed / degraded.

The current run implemented code and contract tests but did not generate that real-data manifest, screenshot evidence or final `report.json`.

## Completed Before Stop

- V2-0 implementation kickoff audit and data_service spike evidence.
- V2-1 mock Runtime adapter and `/v1/knowledge/*` skeleton.
- V2-2 SaveToKnowledgeCard and service status card.
- V2-3 controlled data_service HTTP boundary client, default disabled.
- V2-4 Knowledge Workspace shell.
- V2-5 Ask with Sources and lightweight Knowledge Graph preview.
- V2-6 PermissionRoot / ForgetSource mock governance UX.

## Latest Verification

```text
PYTHONPATH=services/local-runtime python3 -m pytest -q services/local-runtime/tests/test_v1_0_0_runtime_skeleton.py services/local-runtime/tests/test_v2_memory_knowledge_api.py services/local-runtime/tests/test_v2_data_service_client.py
npm --prefix apps/chrome-extension run typecheck
npm --prefix apps/chrome-extension test -- contentBridge mindmap_renderer ArtifactInlineCard
npm --prefix apps/chrome-extension run validate:v2-memory
npm --prefix apps/chrome-extension run build
git diff --check
```

Latest local result:

```text
27 Runtime tests passed
typecheck passed
41 frontend regression tests passed
V2 machine gate passed
Chrome extension build passed
git diff --check passed
```

## False-Green Decision

Do not claim:

- `V2 Memory / Personal Knowledge Base passed planning-aligned local knowledge acceptance.`
- `V2 implemented.`
- `V2 Memory / RAG ready.`
- real data_service adapter enabled in product UI.
- default local file access enabled.

## Required Next Step

Prepare and execute V2-7 real-data acceptance:

```text
docs/active/project/evidence/v2_memory_personal_knowledge_base/sample-manifest.json
docs/active/project/evidence/v2_memory_personal_knowledge_base/report.json
docs/active/project/evidence/v2_memory_personal_knowledge_base/acceptance-report.html
docs/active/project/evidence/v2_memory_personal_knowledge_base/screenshots/
```

The report must validate against `docs/active/project/contracts/v2_memory_report.schema.json` and pass semantic review before the V2 acceptance claim is allowed.
